# Criticism Research Agent

This repository contains a **Google ADK–based agent** designed to help **structure ideas for applications** by analyzing them critically and from multiple perspectives.

## Purpose

My goal with this project is to build a simple agent that act as a **research (using Google Search) and critique assistant**, helping developers and product thinkers refine ideas before implementation.

## Key Capabilities

The agent focuses on:

- **Competitive Analysis**: Detecting competitor weaknesses and market gaps.
- **User Research**: Uncovering user pain points and unmet needs.
- **Quality Review**: Critiquing requirements for completeness and clarity.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Refining ideas based on structured feedback.

## Use Cases

- **Brainstorming and refining** app ideas
- **Early product validation**
- **Concept analysis** and critique
- **Improving problem statements** and solution framing

## Notes

- All prompts in this repository were **generated using Claude Sonnet 4.5**
